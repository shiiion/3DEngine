TEAM: Adam K. Ivan K. Adharsh B. Sam P.

Projects:
	3DGame - Tester project and startup project for the solution, compiled as .exe
	core - core project includes physics and core threads (world, physics objects, etc), compiled as .dll
	gameUI - gameUI project controls what will be rendered (menu, game, etc), compiled as .dll
	render - render project contains gl code and a simple interface for rendering (mesh, lighting, etc), compiled as .dll
	


Ideas:
	get the person to the goal dude bdroude!
	1st (or 3rd) person
	mirrors edge type (running) (wall running)?

World Object Hierarchy:
	Physics Object  ->      Renderable		->			Entity
	(collision mesh)  (rendered mesh, scale)   (XYZ, YPR, velocity, accel)

	collision mesh is a struct with a type (sphere, prism)

	collision mesh has function to check collision with another collision mesh

	physicsobjects have a collision time variable which controls how hard it will bounce (result velocity of two objects)
