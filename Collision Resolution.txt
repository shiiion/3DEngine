object hitting ground:
a(tf-ti) = v1

IPhysicsObject* obj = colliders.at(0);

this->setVelocity(x,y,z) = this->getAcceleration()*(this->getMaterial().collisionTime + obj->getMaterial().collisionTime)/2;

hyperplane: The plane that was crossed is an infinitely expanding plane in 3D space

split each collision mesh into faces, split each face into triangles, test collision between triangle and each point of object
point whose collision occurs earliest gets the entire physics object resolved as such
